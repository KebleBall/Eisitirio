            <li>It is forbidden for any user to register multiple accounts for the purposes of evading limits on the number of tickets per person. Any person found to be doing so will have all their tickets deemed void, and no refund will be given.</li>

            <li>It is your responsibility to ensure that you either arrange for your ticket and those of any guests you may bring to be posted to you, or that you collect them at one of the ticket collection sessions to be held in the week prior to the ball. If you are not able to attend at any of the given times for whatever reason, it is your responsibility to contact the {{ template_config['BALL_NAME'] }} Committee by email to discuss alternative arrangements.</li>
            <li>A ticket owner may collect any of the tickets they own; a guest may only collect the ticket attached to their account which they will use for entry.</li>
            <li>You must check that you have been given the correct number of tickets when you come to collect your order. No discussion will be entered into once you have collected your tickets.</li>
            <li>Tickets can only be collected upon presentation of photographic ID of the purchaser or ticket holder. Accepted forms of ID are official University ID cards, driving licenses, and passports. Other forms of ID, or ID with an expired date, will not be accepted.</li>
            <li>{{ template_config['BALL_NAME'] }} Committee reserves the right to refuse admittance, with no refund of ticket, to any guest who they believe is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs.</li>
            <li>You are obliged to wear the given security ID at all times and carry with you valid photo ID in order to comply with security checks at the entrance and during the event. Failure to do so may result in your expulsion from the premises, with no refund of your ticket.</li>
            <li>{{ template_config['TITLE'] }} will operate a strict no re-admittance policy. Any guest who leaves the Ball after having been admitted, will have their security ID removed and will not be allowed to re-enter under any circumstances whatsoever.</li>

            <li>Any person whose behaviour is judged to be unruly or offensive by {{ template_config['BALL_NAME'] }} Committee will be expelled from the Ball immediately, will not be allowed to re-enter and will not be given a refund.</li>
            <li>The purchaser of tickets will be responsible for their own behaviour and the behaviour of any guests that they bring into the ball.</li>
            <li>Any attendees of {{ template_config['TITLE'] }} who are found to be aiding non-ticket holders in an attempt to gain entry, will be immediately expelled from the ball, with no refund of their ticket.</li>
            <li>You agree to follow the instructions of {{ template_config['BALL_NAME'] }} Committee throughout the ball and in the unfortunate event of an emergency, you will comply with the health and safety procedures which the {{ template_config['BALL_NAME'] }} Committee has in place.</li>
            <li>Neither {{ template_config['BALL_NAME'] }} Committee nor {{ template_config['COLLEGE'] }} College are liable for any loss, damage or injuries sustained at the ball.</li>
            <li>{{ template_config['BALL_NAME'] }} Committee reserves the right to amend the programme for the event at any point.</li>
            <li>The battels payment process is not reversible after the end of 8th week in the term to which the payment was charged. Any tickets paid for by battels which are cancelled after the end of 8th week in the term to which the payment was charged will still be charged to battels, and a refund will only be applied to battels for the current term.</li>
            <li>{{ template_config['BALL_NAME'] }} Committee will acccept no responsibility for tickets that have been lost between the ticket allocation session and the evening of the ball itself, {{ template_config['START_TIME'].strftime('%d') }}{{ get_ord(template_config['START_TIME']) }} {{ template_config['START_TIME'].strftime('%B %Y') }}. In this situation, no entry will be granted to anyone who claims to have lost their ticket and no discussion will be entered into.</li>
            <li>Gates will close on the night at {{ template_config['GATES_CLOSE'].strftime('%I%p')|lower }}. After this hour no one will be admitted to the ball, regardless of whether they have a ticket or not.</li>
