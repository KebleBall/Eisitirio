Hello,

{{ transaction.user.full_name }} has just attempted to pay for some tickets, but eWay only approved the payment for a partial amount. To save lots of complexity in making sure the right amount is paid, we need to completely refund the partial payment, and then allow the user to try again for the full amount.

You should log in to the eWay Merchant gateway, find transaction {{ transaction.eway_id }}, and refund it for the full amount that was charged. You should then email {{ transaction.user.forenames }} ({{ transaction.user.email }}) and ask them to attempt payment for the tickets again.

Best Wishes,

{{ template_config['EMAIL_SIGNOFF'] }}
