"""Helper module giving direct access to all the database models.

Because the modules containing the definition of each model are named for the
model, importing them tends to introduce name conflicts between the module and
variables/parameters containing instances of the model.

To avoid this, this module provides a quick way to access all the models with a
name that is less likely to conflict.
